# CNN-Based-Image-Classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. Data augmentation is applied to enhance performance, leading to improved accuracy across 10 classes. The results demonstrate significant gains, offering insights for further optimization in computer vision tasks.



# Preprocessing Techniques:
Resizing: Adjusts images to a uniform size, often reducing or increasing dimensions to ensure consistency across the dataset.
Normalization: Scales pixel values to a range (typically 0 to 1), improving model convergence and stability.
Augmentation: Applies random transformations like rotation, flipping, and cropping to increase dataset diversity and prevent overfitting.

# Model:
Architecture: The model used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is effective for image recognition tasks. It typically includes layers such as convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.
Key Features: The CNN model leverages multiple convolutional layers followed by activation functions (e.g., ReLU), pooling layers, and a final fully connected layer with a softmax activation function for classification into the 10 classes.
This combination of preprocessing and CNN architecture helps in achieving high classification accuracy and robustness in identifying various objects in the image dataset.
